		<h2 class="title">About</h2>
		<p>Welcome to Paw Day Care we are a dog walking service covering Kent and the surrounding areas. We have experienced, insured and fully vetted dog walkers available in the following areas:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Thanet</li>
			<li>Ramsgate</li>
			<li>Margate</li>
			<li>Broadstairs</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Our family run business was born out of our love for dogs, having been a regular user of dog walkers myself I am all too aware of the difficulty in finding reliable and trustworthy people to look after my beloved pets. I started my very own dog walking service two years ago, which has gone from strength to strength – I am very fortunate to have created a job for myself and others which I truly love! 

		We provide a free initial consultation so we can tailor the package to your personal circumstances and needs.
